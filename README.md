Hi there, I'm Jerry, an undergraduate computer science student at Bandung Institute of Technology. Lately, i found interest in computer vision and embedded devices. I've been working on various software engineering projects related to business or artificial intelligence stuffs. Currently in my third year, I'm exploring a wide range of topics within software engineering and striving to be adaptive, a fast learner, and to contribute with my current skills. I frequently utilize GitHub to store collaborative projects with my colleagues or to contribute to the community.

### üñ•Ô∏è Tech Skills I'm trying to improve:
- Computer Vision/Machine Learning
- Full Stack Web Development
- Internet of Things
- And of course, database... :)
